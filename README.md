To acquire historical trajectories of pedestrians in realistic, crowded scenes, we utilized the Anylogic simulation software to create a model of a transportation hub. 
Our simulation, based on a Chengdu city subway station, accurately portrayed crowded pedestrian movements within the building. 
The model generated trajectory data for approximately 3,500 pedestrians over 120 minutes, serving as the foundation for our study.
